A CSS Robot friend with some hover animation and transition effects

## What the Robot does

Really simply, the robot has a few different :hover effects;

<ul>
  <li>Head: Raises</li>
  <li>Eyes: Eyes close and change color</li>
  <li>Left Arm: Waves</li>
  <li>Right Arm: Disco</li>
  <li>Left Leg: Rotate</li>
  <li>Right Leg: Rotate</li>
</ul>
 
The arm hovers are animations that I set, while the others are simply transition/transform properties. This was my first experimentation with CSS animation effects.
